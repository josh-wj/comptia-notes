## Infrastructer conditions
   - Device placement
   - Security Zones
   - Attack Surface
   - Connecrivity
   - failure Modes
   - Device Attributes
   - Server Communications/Access
   - Network Applications
   - Port Security
   - Firewall Types
## Secure Communications/Access
   - Virtual Private network (VPN)
   - Remote Access
   - Tunneling
   - Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN)
## Device Placement
   > Is the thoghtful positioning of hardware positioning of hardware devices within a network
### Considerations
       - Security Requirments
       - Network Efficiency
       - Accessability
### Examples
      - Place firewalls close to the network perimeter to prevent unauthorized access
      - Position sensitive data servers in secure locations to minimize exposure to threats

## Security zones
> Segragated areas in a network under specific security policies and controls\

    Internal zones
    > Trusted segments in which sensitive or internal data is proccessed\
    
    External Zones
    > Areas allowing connections from public internet or other untrusted networks\
    
    Screened Subnet
    > Specialized external zone that isolates public-facing services from the internet\
    
    Specialized Zones
    > Zones designed to meet regulatory compliance requirments\

## Attack Surface
> All the vulns. and potential access points an attacker could use to gain access to the system

    **Larger Surface** = Greater Risk
